Clause Buddy
Understand complex legal documents in plain English using the power of Google Gemini. This full-stack application provides a user-friendly interface to upload documents, ask specific questions, and automatically scan for risky clauses.

Core Features
Document Upload: Securely upload your legal documents in various formats (.pdf, .docx, .txt). The backend processes and prepares them for analysis.

Question Answering (RAG): Ask specific questions about your document (e.g., "What are the termination conditions?") and receive concise, easy-to-understand answers generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.

Risk Analysis: Automatically scan your document to identify and explain important legal clauses such as Termination, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnification, complete with severity ratings (High, Medium, Low).
